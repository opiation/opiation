## Hey there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Nick.

I'm a software developer and drummer with a penchant for free software, mathematical rhythmic relationships and decentralizing control of technology. I'm trying to live my life by my values while helping build fun, useful stuff along the way.

- I work in JS a lot
- I use Emacs too much
